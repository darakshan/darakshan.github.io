1) Esseys menu leads to index page titled "Posts" (but Posts appears nowhere in folder tree)
2) Have to title posts folder "post" to get it to work in menu
3) Travel section gets no index page - nada zip empty not even a 404
4) Would like to be able to click images and have them show in full screen

+ borrowed fluidimage/pure from blackburn
- can't stack 3 x 1/3 column images or 2 x 1/2 height images, they are just slightly too big
- how to center wide images in a narrow pure column?
- image= property on posts are relative to static/images/, pure directives are relative to static/
- so pure images can be located with content, but featured images cannot (unless you put an images folder there!)
- how to flow text around pure images


Blackburn
  + nice menus
  + responsive menus
  + users yahoo's pure: nice image formatting
  - no featured images
  - doesn't handle multiple content folders
  
Hugo Theme Robust Hacked
  + nice grid summary of posts (but only two columns because of big sidebar)
  + added PURE for images
  - poor menus, not responsive and ugly
  - simple featured images via image= metadata
  
Shall I: search for more themes, or merge these?
