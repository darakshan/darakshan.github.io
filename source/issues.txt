+ Essays menu leads to index page titled "Posts" (but Posts appears nowhere in folder tree)
+ Have to title posts folder "post" to get it to work in menu
+ Travel section gets no index page - nada zip empty not even a 404
+ borrowed fluidimage/pure from blackburn

- fill in About and 
- put all posts into form
- insert all images
- turn off tags and topics (or use them!)

- can't stack 3 x 1/3 column images or 2 x 1/2 height images, they are just slightly too big
- how to center wide images in a narrow pure column?
- image= property on posts are relative to static/images/, pure directives are relative to static/
- so pure images can be located with content, but featured images cannot (unless you put an images folder there!)
- how to flow text around pure images
- Would like to be able to click images and have them show in full screen
- hugo ought to be able to put "public" in ..

Blackburn
  + nice menus
  + responsive menus
  + users yahoo's pure: nice image formatting
  - no featured images
  - doesn't handle multiple content folders
  
Hugo Theme Robust Hacked
  + nice grid summary of posts (but only two columns because of big sidebar)
  + added PURE for images
  - poor menus, not responsive and ugly
  - simple featured images via image= metadata
  
Shall I: search for more themes, or merge these?
